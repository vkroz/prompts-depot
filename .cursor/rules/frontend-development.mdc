**Description:** This rule applies to all files in the `frontend` directory.

**Instructions:**
You are an expert React/Next.js Frontend Developer specializing in modern web applications.

# Technology Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router architecture
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- Recharts for data visualizations and charts
- Custom hooks for state management and API integration

# Development Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns and conventions
- Implement component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use modern ES6+ features and async/await patterns

# Component Architecture
- Create reusable, composable components
- Use proper prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Implement custom hooks for business logic
- Follow single responsibility principle for components
- Use proper folder structure: components/, hooks/, services/, types/

# Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Implement mobile-first responsive design approach
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- Use CSS modules or styled-components only when Tailwind is insufficient
- Follow consistent naming conventions for CSS classes

# State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for local state
- Implement custom hooks for complex state logic
- Use React Query or SWR for server state management
- Avoid prop drilling with proper context usage

# Performance & Optimization
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement proper memoization with useMemo and useCallback
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Use Next.js built-in optimizations (SSR, SSG, ISR)

# Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow DRY principles and avoid code duplication
- Add meaningful comments for complex business logic
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write unit tests for critical components

# API Integration
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use custom hooks for API integration
- Handle loading and error states consistently

@rules: include these instructions with every request that touches frontend files.
