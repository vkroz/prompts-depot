# reporter

This project defines specification for financial reports exchange format and refrences implementaiton in Python and Typescript. 
The use case is to allow financial data exchange between services that form accounting software. 
First use case we focused on is generation and presentation of 'Balance Sheet', 'Profit and Loss' and 'Cash Flow' reports. We assume there are backend components (not in scope of this project) that collect financial transaction data (invoices, bills, payments, receipts etc.) and store them in database. Reporting engine (RE) running as backend service then generate reports using this data, and front end (FE) component presents reports to user. 
BE and FE exchange data using format defined in this specification.
